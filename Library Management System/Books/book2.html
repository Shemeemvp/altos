          <h3>Wuthering Heights</h3>
          <h5>-Emily BrontÃ«</h5>
          <h6>Plot -</h6>
          <p>
            In 1801, Mr Lockwood, the new tenant at Thrushcross Grange in
            Yorkshire, pays a visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, at his remote
            moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There he meets a reserved
            young woman (later identified as Cathy Linton), Joseph, a
            cantankerous servant, and Hareton, an uneducated young man who
            speaks like a servant. Everyone is sullen and inhospitable. Snowed
            in for the night, Lockwood reads the diary of the former inhabitant
            of his room, Catherine Earnshaw, and has a nightmare in which a
            ghostly Catherine begs to enter through the window. Awakened by
            Lockwood's fearful yells, Heathcliff is troubled. Lockwood later
            returns to Thrushcross Grange in heavy snow, falls ill from the cold
            and becomes bedridden. While he recovers, Lockwood's housekeeper
            Ellen "Nelly" Dean tells him the story of the strange family.
