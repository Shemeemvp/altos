          <h3>The Grapes of Wrath</h3>
          <h5>-John Steinbeck</h5>
          <h6>Plot -</h6>
          <p>
            The narrative begins just after Tom Joad is paroled from McAlester
            prison, where he had been incarcerated after being convicted of
            homicide in self-defense. While hitchhiking to his home near
            Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Tom meets former preacher Jim Casy, whom he
            remembers from his childhood, and the two travel together. Arriving
            at Tom's childhood farm home, they find it deserted. Disconcerted
            and confused, Tom and Casy meet an old neighbor, Muley Graves, who
            says the family is at Uncle John Joad's home nearby. Graves says the
            banks have evicted all the farmers. They have moved away, but Muley
            refuses to leave the area.
