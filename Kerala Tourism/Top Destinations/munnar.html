            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge -
            Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala. 1,600 m above sea level, this
            hill station was once the summer resort of the erstwhile British
            Government in South India. One of the most sought after honeymoon
            destinations in Kerala, Munnar is replete with resorts and lodging
            facilities that fit a wide rage of budgets. Sprawling tea
            plantations, picturesque towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities
            make this a popular resort town. Among the exotic flora found in the
            forests and grasslands here is the Neelakurinji. This flower which
            bathes the hills in blue once in every twelve years, will bloom next
            in 2030. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anamudi,
            which towers over 2,695 m. <br /><br />
            The region has been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribals like the
            Malayarayan and Muthuvan for thousands of years. Tradition states
            that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, was the
            first British person to pass through Munnar during Tippu Sultan's
            campaign in Travancore, but this is unsubstantiated. The first
            survey of the terrain was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in
            1816â€“1817, who followed the Periyar into the Western Ghats and
            established a camp at the confluence of three rivers, from which the
            name of Munnar is derived.
