            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kuttanad, the 'Rice Bowl of Keralaâ€™, lies at the
            very heart of the backwaters in Alappuzha district. Its wealth of
            paddy crops is what got it this unique nickname. Based in the inner
            regions of the district, it is a huge area of reclaimed land,
            separated by dikes from water which is higher than it appears. The
            view of the countryside is what enchants all who pass through this
            area while travelling via houseboats. It has been speculated that it
            is perhaps the only place in the world where farming is done up to 2
            meters below sea level. The area is serviced by 4 major rivers:
            Pampa, Meenachil, Achankovil and Manimala. <br /><br />
            The Alappuzha - Changanassery Road that passes through the heart of
            Kuttanad is famous for itsscenic view of this locale. One gets to
            view a slice of the traditional country lifestyle. Visits to these
            villages can be a life changing experience. Especially during the
            harvest season, one finds farmers working in the fields most of the
            day. The early hours of the day brings to us the sight of women
            carrying sickles to the fields while men are busy sowing seeds and
            getting rid of weeds. Fields with rice stalks have legions of
            parrots hovering around them. One may also see darter birds flying
            around as they are known to be around the area surrounding the
            backwaters.
