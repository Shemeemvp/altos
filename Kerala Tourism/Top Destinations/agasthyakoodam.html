            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Agasthyakoodam is nature’s ode to bird watchers.
            One of the highest peaks in Kerala, it has long been known as a bird
            watcher’s paradise and many gather here to catch sight of exotic
            avian species. It can be viewed from near Neyyar Dam as well as
            Bonacaud. Agasthyakoodam is also known for its remarkable flora and
            fauna, especially certain rare medicinal herbs which have been
            discovered here. Over 2000 species including lichens, orchids,
            mosses and ferns have been recorded in the area.
            <br /><br />
            The peak was named after the sage Agasthya and is a popular pilgrim
            site. A shrine dedicated to him is located here and is frequented by
            devotees. The air itself is said to have medicinal qualities. The
            peak is a 90 minute drive with Bonacaud being the last motorable
            spot. Trekking is restricted as only a few people are allowed to go
            up the peak. One must get a forest pass from the wildlife office in
            Thiruvananthapuram with January to April being the recommended
            months.
